## 1. **Story Overview**

*He was the Chosen One. He was meant to destroy the Sith… not join them. But destiny burns hotter than lava.*

On the volcanic world of Mustafar, the fate of the galaxy teeters on the edge of two blades. In this reimagining of *Episode III*, Anakin Skywalker defeats Obi-Wan Kenobi — but instead of pledging full loyalty to Darth Sidious, he turns against both Jedi and Sith. Now free from all orders and blinded by rage, Anakin carves his own path in a galaxy that thinks he's dead.

Obi-Wan survives the duel but is gravely injured and left behind. With the Empire rising and Padmé’s fate uncertain, both men must face the consequences of their choices — not as Jedi, not as Sith, but as warriors whose last battle never really ended.

## 2. **Setting/Background**

**Time & Place:**
Mustafar, the final act of *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*. The Republic has just fallen. The Jedi Order lies in ruins following Order 66. Anakin, seduced by Darth Sidious, has murdered the Separatist leadership. Obi-Wan has arrived to stop him.

**Canon Divergence:**
The story splits from canon at the climax of their duel. Instead of Obi-Wan defeating Anakin on the lava bank, Anakin anticipates Obi-Wan’s high-ground tactic and strikes first, defeating — but not killing — his former master. He rejects both the Jedi and the Sith, claiming no allegiance.

## 4. **Acted Story Scene with Full Dialogue**

```
[Scene: Mustafar. Bridge above the lava river. The structure quakes with heat and tremors. Fire dances below. A final blow is imminent.]

Obi-Wan charges, leaping toward the embankment — the infamous *high ground*.

OBI-WAN: “It’s over, Anakin! Don’t try it!”

But this time, Anakin doesn’t hesitate.

He *feints* left, rolls through the ash, and surges *under* the leap with an upward slash.

Steel meets flesh.

Obi-Wan's lightsaber flies from his hand. He tumbles to the ground, clutching a burned shoulder, coughing through the sulfur.

ANAKIN: (low, savage)  
You taught me to trust my instincts. Bad lesson.

OBI-WAN: (gasping)  
Anakin… please. Let this end.

ANAKIN: (stepping closer, saber lit)  
No. It *begins* now. I see it all clearly. The Jedi lied. The Sith used me. But I’ll burn them *all* down.

He holds the blade inches from Obi-Wan’s throat — but stops.

A flicker of pain flashes across his face.

Padmé appears at the far end of the platform, coughing from the smoke.

PADMÉ: “Anakin!”

Anakin turns, and his saber deactivates with a hiss. Obi-Wan watches, helpless.

PADMÉ: (shaking)  
“Is this what we fought for? Is this who you are now?”

ANAKIN:  
I did it for *you*. For us. To protect what we—

PADMÉ: (interrupting)  
You *killed* children, Anakin!

Anakin flinches.

Suddenly — the air *booms* as Palpatine’s ship descends behind them. Red light floods the ridge.

ANAKIN: (to Padmé, eyes wide)  
He followed you here?

PADMÉ: (softly)  
He followed *you*.

A blast wave knocks her off her feet. Anakin turns, eyes blazing, as Sidious descends the ramp.

PALPATINE: (grinning)  
My apprentice. You’ve done well. Now finish it. Kill the Jedi — and the woman — and rise as Lord Vader.

Anakin stares at Obi-Wan. Then at Padmé. Then at Sidious.

He ignites his blade.

But this time, *he turns it on Palpatine*.

ANAKIN: (roaring)  
I’m *no one’s* pawn!

```

## 5. **Single Plot Twist or Open-Ended Hook**

**Action Twist:**
Anakin betrays Palpatine — *publicly and violently* — and escapes with Padmé into the shadows of the galaxy.

The galaxy believes both Vader and Anakin are dead. But Palpatine knows better.

In the Outer Rim, whispers begin: of a warrior in black who fights both Jedi and Empire — and whose fury burns hotter than any Sith.

The war for the soul of the galaxy is not over.
It’s only gone rogue.
