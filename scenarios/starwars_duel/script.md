# Star Wars: The Mustafar Duel - Script

## Scene 1: The Landing Platform

**Setting:** A landing platform on Mustafar. A river of lava flows nearby, casting an ominous glow. The air is thick with smoke and ash.

**Characters:**
- OBI-WAN KENOBI: A Jedi Master, his face a mask of sorrow and determination.
- ANAKIN SKYWALKER: A newly anointed Sith Lord, his eyes burning with anger and betrayal.

**(The scene opens with OBI-WAN walking down the ramp of his ship. ANAKIN stands waiting for him, his back turned.)**

**OBI-WAN**
Anakin!

**(ANAKIN turns, his expression is one of pure hatred.)**

**ANAKIN**
I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do.

**OBI-WAN**
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!

**ANAKIN**
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.

**OBI-WAN**
Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.

**(OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same. They circle each other, the hum of their blades filling the air.)**

## Scene 2: The Duel in the Facility

**Setting:** The interior of a massive mining facility. Catwalks and platforms are suspended over rivers of lava.

**(The duel is fast and furious. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN exchange blows, their movements a blur of motion. The environment is interactive, with sparks flying as their lightsabers clash with the machinery.)**

**OBI-WAN**
I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.

**ANAKIN**
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over!

**OBI-WAN**
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

**ANAKIN**
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!

**(They lock blades, their faces inches apart.)**

**OBI-WAN**
Well, then you are lost!

## Scene 3: The Lava River

**Setting:** A river of lava. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are on a small mining droid, floating down the river.

**(The duel becomes even more perilous. They must balance on the droid while fighting for their lives. The Ghibli-esque art style makes the lava look both beautiful and terrifying.)**

**ANAKIN**
This is the end for you, Master.

**OBI-WAN**
It's over, Anakin! I have the high ground!

**ANAKIN**
You underestimate my power!

**OBI-WAN**
Don't try it.

**(ANAKIN leaps. OBI-WAN's lightsaber flashes. ANAKIN falls, dismembered, at the edge of the lava river.)**

---

## Scene 4: The Aftermath

**Setting:** The shore of the lava river. ANAKIN is crawling, his body burning.

**(OBI-WAN looks down at ANAKIN, his heart breaking.)**

**OBI-WAN**
You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness!

**(OBI-WAN picks up ANAKIN's lightsaber and walks away, leaving his former apprentice to his fate.)**

**(The scene fades to black.)**
