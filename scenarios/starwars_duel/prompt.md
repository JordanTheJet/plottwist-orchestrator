# Game Prompt: Star Wars - The Mustafar Duel

## 1. Scenario

The game will recreate the iconic and tragic duel between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi on the volcanic planet of Mustafar, as seen in *Star Wars: Episode III â€“ Revenge of the Sith*.

The narrative will focus on the emotional core of the conflict: a master confronting his fallen apprentice, a brother fighting a brother. The dialogue and key moments should reflect the betrayal, anger, and sorrow of the two characters.

Key scenes to include:
- The initial confrontation on the landing platform.
- The duel throughout the mining facility.
- The perilous fight on the lava river.
- The final, devastating moments of the battle.

## 2. Genre

**Action / Cinematic Visual Novel**

The gameplay will be a blend of fast-paced action sequences and emotionally charged narrative choices.

-   **Action:** The lightsaber combat should be fluid and intense. Quick-time events (QTEs) or a simplified combat system could be used to represent the acrobatic and dangerous nature of the duel.
-   **Narrative:** The player will experience the story from both Anakin's and Obi-Wan's perspectives, making choices that might not change the ultimate outcome but will reveal deeper insights into their thoughts and feelings.

## 3. Art Style

**Studio Ghibli**

The visual direction will be inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli. This choice is meant to emphasize the emotional depth and fairy-tale-like tragedy of the story.

-   **Characters:** Characters should be expressive, with designs that capture the essence of the actors but are rendered in a softer, more animated style. Emphasis on facial expressions and body language to convey the intense emotions.
-   **Environments:** The volcanic world of Mustafar should be depicted with the beauty and terror of a Ghibli landscape. Think lush, hand-painted backgrounds with vibrant, flowing lava, and dramatic skies filled with ash and smoke. The industrial structures should feel both immense and fragile against the power of nature.
-   **Color Palette:** A rich color palette will be used to create a strong mood. The fiery oranges, reds, and yellows of the lava will contrast with the dark, oppressive tones of the machinery and the deep blues and purples of the sky.
